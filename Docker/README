SharedDB API Docker Work
========================

This is a work in progress repo, dockerizing the API.

Very incomplete.

Needs to be combined with the existing Puppet work, uploaded in an independent branch because TJNII needs to stop working in a vacuum.

Containers:
-----------

- api: RESTful API
- clisandbox: Test sandbox containing test utilities, inteneded to be run interactively
- db: MongoDB container backing the API
- testdb_loader: Loads test data into the DB container
